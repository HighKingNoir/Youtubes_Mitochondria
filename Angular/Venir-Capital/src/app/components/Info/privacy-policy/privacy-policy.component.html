                    with information you have previously provided us. For instance, depending on the
                    type of request you submit, we may ask you to provide certain information so that we
                    can match the information you provide with the information we already have on file,
                    or we may contact you through a communication method (e.g., phone or email) that
                    you have previously provided to us. We may also use other verification methods as
                    the circumstances dictate.
